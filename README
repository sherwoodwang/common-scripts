Here are the scripts I've copied to many machines.

I'm collecting some more from the boxes I administrates. Most scripts were
written for specific purposes. After I clean them up and add enough comments, I
put them here.

Usages are described in each file. Here is an index:
	backup		manages incremental backups with tar.
	funcs		includes functions which may be useful.
	packconf	helps create a bash script which is an installer for
			configuration files which are taken from the current
			system.
	sandbox/	turns a Debian into sandbox mode, so that the root
			filesystem could be read-only.
	update-env	can be used with tmux to update environment variables
			after each attaching.
